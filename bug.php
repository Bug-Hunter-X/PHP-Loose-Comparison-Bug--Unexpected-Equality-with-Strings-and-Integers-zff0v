In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with string comparisons involving loosely typed variables.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$var1 = '10';
$var2 = 10;

if ($var1 == $var2) {
  echo "Variables are equal";
} else {
  echo "Variables are not equal";
}
```

While one might expect the output to be "Variables are not equal" (since one is a string and the other an integer), PHP's loose comparison (`==`) will actually trigger the "Variables are equal" output. This is because PHP implicitly converts the types during the comparison.

This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in conditional statements where strict type checking is crucial.  Incorrect database queries, flawed authentication systems, and unexpected logic flow are potential consequences.
