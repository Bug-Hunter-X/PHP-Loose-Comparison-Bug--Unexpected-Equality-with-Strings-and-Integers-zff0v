# PHP Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in PHP related to loose comparisons (using `==`) between strings and integers.  PHP's loose typing can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types, potentially causing significant issues in applications. 

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a solution using strict comparison (`===`).  Always prioritize strict comparison for reliable type checking in your PHP applications.
